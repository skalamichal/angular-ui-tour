## About

Angular UI Tour is a plugin that uses Angular UI Bootstrap's popovers to display a guided product tour. This was
originally inspired by [Bootstrap Tour](http://www.bootstraptour.com) as [Angular Bootstrap Tour](http://github.com/benmarch/angular-bootstrap-tour),
but after much feedback to remove the jQuery dependency, Angular UI Tour was born. It uses many of the features from
Bootstrap Tour, but plays nicely with Angular, **and does not have any dependency on Twitter Bootstrap or jQuery!**

Check out the live demo [here](http://benmarch.github.io/angular-ui-tour).

## Versions 

If you are using **Angular Bootstrap 1.x**, please use **Angular UI Tour 0.5.x**. If you are using **Angular Bootstrap 2.x**, please use **Angular UI Tour 0.6.x or later**. Older versions of Angular Bootstrap are no longer supported, sorry.

## Getting Started
*It is highly recommended that you use Bower and Wiredep to install this plugin for now. I am working on making it (and its dependencies) 
available through NPM, but I don't believe it works yet.*
 
Get the package:

```sh
bower install angular-ui-tour
```

Add the script tags:

```html
<!--dependencies:js-->
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-bootstrap/ui-bootstrap-tpls.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/ngSmoothScroll/lib/angular-smooth-scroll.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/ez-ng/dist/ez-ng.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-hotkeys/build/hotkeys.js"></script>
<!--end dependencies-->

<!--Angular UI Tour-->
<script src="bower_components/angular-ui-tour/dist/angular-ui-tour.js"></script>
```

**Note:** You _must_ use the unminified version of angular smooth scroll since there is a known issue with the minified version.

Then add the module to your app:

```js
angular.module('myApp', ['bm.uiTour']);
``` 
    
Add some styles for the backdrop (feel free to style it however you want):

```css
.tour-backdrop {
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```
    
## Tour Configuration

Tours can be configured either programatically in a config block, or declaratively as part of the uiTour directive declaration.

To configure in a config block, use TourConfigProvider.set(optionName, optionValue);

To configure on a tour declaration, use `ui-tour-<option-name>="optionValue"`

**Important:** If a lifecyle hook event is overridden in a config block, the function **must** return a promise.
 If it is overridden in the directive declaration, it will be wrapped in a promise automatically. If the function returns
 a promise, it will wait until it is resolved before moving on.

## Tour Steps

Tour steps are extensions of [Angular UI's Tooltips](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/tooltip) and therefore all
options are available. Although there are 3 types of Tooltips, there is only one type of Tour Step. In addition, almost
all of the Tour options can be overridden by individual tour steps, as well as additional options that can be changed.

To configure on a tour step declaration, use `tour-step-<option-name>="optionValue"`

| content          | string   | ""                        | The content of the popup. **Note:** can contain HTML                                                                                                        |
| order            | number   | null                      | The order in which the step will be displayed. Although it is optional, the behavior is undefined if this is not explicitly set.                            |
| enabled          | boolean  | true                      | This will enable or disable the tour step.                                                                                                                  |

| preventScrolling | boolean  | false                     | Should page scrolling be prevented when popup is shown (I don't recommend using this, but there are times when it is useful). Only works with a backdrop.   |
| scrollIntoView   | boolean  | true                      | Should the tour scroll the page so that the tour step is visible once it is shown. Set to false when you don't want any scrolling to occur.                 |
| nextStep         | string   | ""                        | If the next step is on a different page, set this to declare the name of the next step.                                                                     |
| nextPath         | string   | ""                        | If the next step is on a different page, set this to the path of the next page. If useUiRouter is true, this will be the state name.                        |
| prevStep         | string   | ""                        | If the previous step is on a different page, set this to declare the name of the previous step.                                                             |
| prevPath         | string   | ""                        | If the previous step is on a different page, set this to the path of the previous page. If useUiRouter is true, this will be the state name.                |
| templateUrl      | string   | "tour-step-template.html" | Used as the template for the contents of the popup (see Angular UI Tooltip docs). |
| tableColumn      | boolean  | false                     | Will select the table column, if the tour-step is added to th or td element in the table. Requires that td elements are placed within the tbody.                   |
| margin           | number   | 0                         | Adds extra margin for selected element.               |

**Best practice:** always set the order so that the steps display in the expected order. Steps with the same order will 
display consecutively, but the order among them is unpredictable. At first, use increments of 10 so that if you need to add steps
in the middle later you won't have to reorder everything.... Remember when code needed line numbers??? :)

## Directives

### uiTour

uiTour is the container for the tour steps; all tour steps must be declared as descendants of uiTour. 
The declaration can be as simple as adding ui-tour to an element, or can include one or more options (shown above).

Examples:

```html
<body ui-tour>
    ... <!-- page content and tour steps -->
</body>


<div ui-tour ui-tour-on-start="onTourStart()" ui-tour-placement="bottom">
    ... <!-- page content and tour steps -->
</div>
```
    
### tourStep

tourSteps declare which elements should have a popup during the tour. They can be declared on any element, but some consideration
should be taken when deciding which element on which to declare them.

Examples:

```html
<body ui-tour>
    <div id="mainMenu" tour-step tour-step-title="Main Menu" tour-step-content="Navigate the site using this menu." tour-step-order="0" tour-step-placement="right">...</div>
    ...
    <div id="settings" tour-step tour-step-title="Settings" tour-step-content="Click here to change your settings." tour-step-order="1">...</div>
    <div id="finalTourMessage" tour-step tour-step-title="Welcome!" tour-step-content="Enjoy using the app!" tour-step-order="1000" tour-step-orphan="true" tour-step-backdrop="true">...</div>
</body>


<!-- fixed element -->
<body ui-tour>
    <header style="position: fixed;" tour-step tour-step-title="Header" tour-step-content="This header is fixed at the top." tour-step-order="0" tour-step-fixed="true">...</header>
</body>


<!-- multi-page tour -->
<!-- layout -->
<body ui-tour>
    <!-- page 1: included using ngView (/page1) -->
    <div tour-step="page1step1" ... tour-step-next-path="page2" tour-step-next-step="page2step1">...</div>
    <!-- /page 1 -->
    
    <!-- page 2: ngView is populated when next step is requested after page1step1 -->
    <div tour-step="page2step1" ... tour-step-prev-path="page1" tour-step-prev-step="page1step1">...</div>
</body>
```

## Tour API

The tour itself has a small API that can be used to control the flow of the tour. The tour object is available on the
scope of the uiTour directive, and can be required as `TourController` in directives on or in the uiTour's subtree.

| Method    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Tour Service

The `uiTourService` can be used for retrieving a reference to a tour object. There are three methods to retrieve the reference (note that they are all synchronous):

| Method                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| getTour()                         | If you have a single tour on your page, this is the easiest way to get the reference to it from a service or controller.                                                                                                                              |
| getTourByName(name)               | If you have multiple tours you can name them by supplying a value to the `ui-tour` attribute. This method allows you to retrieve a tour by name.                                                                                                      |
| getTourByElement(element)         | If you want to know which tour is available to a specific element (in order to create a tour step, for example) you can pass the element into this method to retrieve the appropriate tour. This can be a DOM element, or jqLite object.              |
| createDetachedTour(name, config)  | Creates a tour that is not associated with a DOM subtree. Steps can be added the detached tour by setting the `tour-step-belongs-to` attribute to the name of the tour. The config object will override global tour options just like a regular tour. |

## Tour Notifications

The tour itself is an event emitter that emits the following notifications. The difference between listening for notifications and setting
lifecycle hook handlers as shown above is that these notifications are outside of the lifecycle of the tour. That means that the notification events are
emitted, and then the tour moves on without waiting for any handlers to finish. By setting a lifecyle hook handler, the tour will
wait for a handler to complete before moving on. If you simply need to know when something happened, use an event notification listener,
but if you need to execute code before the tour moves continues, set an lifecycle hook handler.

Listen for the following events using this pattern:

```js
tour.on('<notificationName>', function (data) {
    //your logic here
});
```

| Notification Name | Timing                                                   | Data          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| initialized       | After config is set                                      | null          |
| started           | Before the first step is shown                           | first step    |
| paused            | After current step is hidden                             | current step  |
| resumed           | Before current step is shown                             | current step  |
| ended             | After last step is hidden                                | null          |
| stepAdded         | After step is added to step list                         | added step    |
| stepRemoved       | After step is removed from step list                     | removed step  |
| stepsReordered    | After all steps have been ordered properly               | null          |
| stepChanged       | After previous step is hidden, before next step is shown | next step     |

## Multiple Tours

If you need to have separate tours on your site there are a couple ways to achieve it. One way is to use separate `ui-tour` directives, and any tour steps
defined within each subtree will belong to the respective tour. This is a fairly idealistic approach because it assumes that you can cleanly separate your tours.
If you need to create multiple tours on the same subtree you have two options: use `tour-step-enabled` and set flags to enable/disable steps when the appropriate
tour is running, or create one or more detached tours and assign steps to them. A detached tour is not associated with a DOM subtree, and steps must be explicitly
assigned to it for them to display. Here is an example of how to set up a detached tour and assign steps:

```js
angular.module('myModule', ['bm.uiTour']).run(['uiTourService', function (uiTourService) {
    uiTourService.createDetachedTour('myDetachedTour', {backdrop: true});
    //the second argument is a map that will override individual global tour options
});
```

```html
<body ui-tour="myTour" ui-tour-backdrop="false">

    <div tour-step tour-step-title="Attached Step" tour-step-content="I belong to 'myTour' because I don't have a 'belongsTo' attribute.">
        This step belongs to it's ancestral tour, not the detached tour.
    </div>
    
    <div tour-step tour-step-belongs-to="myDetachedTour" tour-step-title="Detached Step" tour-step-content="I belong to 'myDetachedTour' because I have specified my tour">
        This step belongs to "myDetachedTour" because it is specified, otherwise it would also belong to "myTour".
    </div>
 
</body>
```

Setting a tour name for detached tours is required, but by adding a name to regular tours you can specify belongsTo for those as well. **Any step that has a belongsTo
attribute will ignore its ancestral tour, and a step can only belong to one tour.**
